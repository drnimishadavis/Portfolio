# 🚀 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview
Fraudulent activities in financial transactions pose a major threat to businesses and individuals. This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** to detect suspicious transactions, reducing financial risks and enhancing security. By analyzing transactional data, our model identifies fraud patterns and flags potentially fraudulent activities with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **robust fraud detection system** using machine learning.
- Analyze financial transaction data to uncover fraud patterns.
- Implement and compare multiple ML models for **high accuracy and minimal false positives**.
- Deploy a real-time fraud detection mechanism for improved security.

## 📊 Dataset
This project utilizes a dataset containing transaction records with features such as:
- **Transaction Type** (Transfer, Cash Out, Payment, etc.)
- **Amount** and balance details before and after transactions.
- **Customer and Recipient IDs**
- **Fraud Labels** (Genuine or Fraudulent transactions)

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Algorithms:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - etc...
- **Label Encoding,Scaling,Feature Engineering,Hyperparameter Tuning, & Model Optimization**
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Dashboard for real-time fraud detection

## 🏗️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical data, standardize numerical values,Outlier Handling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize fraud patterns, detect correlations, and outlier analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selecting the most relevant attributes to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation** – Train multiple ML models, fine-tune hyperparameters, and compare metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment** – Implement the trained model in a real-world fraud detection system.
   
## ✅ Train & Test Accuracy
- **Training Accuracy:** 99.96%
- **Test Accuracy:** 99.92%

### 🔢 Confusion Matrix
- **True Positives (9978):** Correctly predicted positive cases.
- **True Negatives (9967):** Correctly predicted negative cases.
- **False Positives (13):** Incorrectly classified as positive.
- **False Negatives (2):** Incorrectly classified as negative.
- **Key Insight:** Very few misclassifications, showing high precision & recall.

### 📊 Classification Report
- **Precision (1.00):** Almost no false positives.
- **Recall (1.00):** Almost no false negatives.
- **F1-score (1.00):** The harmonic mean of precision and recall is perfect.
- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Tuning:** The near-perfect performance suggests that hyperparameter tuning has been performed effectively, optimizing for both bias and variance.

## ⚡ Key Features
